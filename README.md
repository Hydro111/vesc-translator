# VESC Translator
*A simple solution for creating VESC messages in Rust.*

## Goals
This project is designed to create messages to send to VESC motor controllers. It was made for Utah Student Robotics at the University of Utah.

## Development
The project is currently in active development, and is not ready to use. It needs a table of messages it can send, proper tests, and more features.
